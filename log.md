# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tried using matplotlib for the first time and plotted my first graph ever.

**Thoughts:** I honestly had so many syntax errors and it didnt work at first, but after a long time of trial and errors, it worked!

### Day 2: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a Python script that asked for user's input.

**Thoughts**: I really got frustrated about 60% of the time I tried to write this code. In the end, I realised that basic syntax errors will be a challenge I'll overcome from continuous practice.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
