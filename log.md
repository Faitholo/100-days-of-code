# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tried using matplotlib for the first time and plotted my first graph ever.

**Thoughts:** I honestly had so many syntax errors and it didnt work at first, but after a long time of trial and errors, it worked!

### Day 2: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a Python script that asked for user's input.

**Thoughts**: I really got frustrated about 60% of the time I tried to write this code. In the end, I realised that basic syntax errors will be a challenge I'll overcome from continuous practice.

### Day 3: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I got my dual boot working.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and was interested in using a Linux os on my Windows pc. After long hours of trying, I was able to setup the Ubuntu 20.04LTS Linux distro on my Windows 10 pc.


### Day 3: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I continued with matplotlib.

**Thoughts** There's so much that can be done with a powerful library. Matplotlib has been a great one to work with. Today, I made a scattered plot and a Histogram.
